					<h2>Tennis</h2>
					<p>Tennis is one of my favorite sports and I have been playing since I was very young. I first started playing with my dad and then i switched over to a varity of coaches. One coach I really liked and he has been traing me recently. I also joined the Gladiator Tennis tournament so I can improve my skills in playing matched. I did all this because I am hoping to make it into the varcity team when I go to highschool and all this training will help me get on the team. </p>

					<h2>Skiing</h2>
					<p>Skiing is also one of my favorite sports and I started when I was very young. I first went skiing in colorados mountains with my parents. I didnt like skiing when I was very little and I would cry every time me went but now I really like it and I especially like going on all the black diamonds wich are the steepest slopes to go on. I usually go skiing every year with my parants or friends.   </p>
					<hr>
					<h2>Taekwando</h2>
					<p>I started taekwando when I was about 9 years old. My mom signed me up for it and I did not want to go but my mom still made me keep going. After I went through some of the belts I stll wanted to quit. I did not quit and pushed trough and then I started to like it. After 3 years I finally got my black belt. I then even got offered a job there for the summer wich I did not expect and I was very happy about. After this offer I took a break from Taekwando and I will join back when I am older to take the job.  </p>

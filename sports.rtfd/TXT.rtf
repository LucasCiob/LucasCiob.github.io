					<h2>Tennis</h2>
					<p>Tennis is one of my favorite sports and I have been playing since I was very young. I first started playing with my dad and then I switched over to a variety of coaches. I really liked one of the coaches and he has been training me since then. I also joined the Gladiator Tennis Tournament so I can improve my skills in playing matches. I did all this because I am hoping to make it on to the varsity team when I go to highschool next year, and all this training will help me get on the team. </p>

					<h2>Skiing</h2>
					<p>Skiing is also one of my favorite sports and I started when I was very young. I first went skiing in the beautiful mountains of Colorado with my parents. I didn't like skiing when I was very little and I would cry every time I went but now I really like it and I especially like going on all the black diamonds wich are the steepest slopes to go on. Lastly, I usually go skiing every year with my parants or friends.   </p>

					<h2>Taekwando</h2>
					<p>I started taekwando when I was about 9 years old. My mom signed me up for it and I did not want to go but my mom still made me keep going. After I went through some of the belts covid-19 happened and I thought this was the perfect opportunity to quit. I stopped going for a while because of the virus and then
					I started to miss going there and I asked my mom when I could start again. After about a week I was training to get my next belt. I was happy that I did not quit and pushed trough. After 2 more years I finally got my black belt. Then I even got offered a job there for the summer which I did not expect, and I was very happy about. After this offer I took a break from taekwando and I will join back when I am older to take the job.  </p>

					<h2>Band</h2>
					<p>I started band when I was in fifth grade. I picked the flute becuase I thought that it would be easier to play. I was totally wrong it would be one of the hardest instruments to play because it required a lot of air to play and it had so many keys to for your fingers to press down. I even thought of switching instruments but I didn't because I wanted a challenge to push through. Once I got into middle school there was an option to join jazz band. I decided to do it and my band director said that I had to pick a different instrument because the flute would not sound good in a jazz band, so I picked the saxophone. I played in the jazz band for a year but I quit after becuase it was hard to try to master two instruments at the same time. After quitting jazz band I wanted to quit normal band too but my band director talked me out of it and looking back at it today I really thank him for that. Lastly, I decided to continue band for freshman year and I am very happy about that because all of my friends decided to continue too.
